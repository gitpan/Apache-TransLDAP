            Apache::TransLDAP - A mod_perl Trans Handler Example
                            by Clayton Donley
============================================================================

INTRODUCTION
------------

This module is an example of how you can create an Trans handler for use
with Apache+mod_perl.  This particular example translates from a user
virtual directory on the server to the 'labeledURI' attribute for the
given user.

INSTALLATION
------------

This module requires Net::LDAPapi.  It can be found on my website at
http://www.wwa.com/~donley/.  I'll be posting a new version that uses
PerLDAP as I find time.

Uncompress and untar the archive.  Then run the following commands:

% perl Makefile.PL
% make

Then as root:

# make install

This will install the module in the appropriate place and make it usable
from your Apache configuration.

USAGE
-----

See the generated POD documentation for examples of how to use this module
from your Apache configuration files.

FEEDBACK
--------

I'm very interested in any ways that you might use this module, or others
that I have developed.  Please send me email at donley@wwa.com.  Bug reports
and questions are welcome as well.
